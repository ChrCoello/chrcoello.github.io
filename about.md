# About

This is the personal blog post of [Christopher Coello](www.elvia.no), a data scientist at the Norwegian distribution system operator [Elvia](www.elvia.no)[https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrcoello/]. This blog is here to present some of the interesting work in the realm of data science applied to grid problemtics.  
On the side of Elvia, I work part-time (20%) at the [Machine Learning Group](https://machine-learning.uit.no/) in Troms√∏ and help the Energy Analytics team lead by Stian Anfinsen to give industrial relevance to the excellent ML work done there.  
On a personal level, I live in a farm with my familiy outside Hamar, Norway and I am an eager ultra trail runner, the sport of running long distances in the mountains.
