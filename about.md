This is the personal blog post of [Christopher Coello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrcoello/), a data shephard with experience from battery company [Hagal](https://www.hagal.no), from the Norwegian distribution system operator [Elvia](www.elvia.no) and from the energy market @ [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/eikon-trading-software/commodity-trading). This blog is here to present a selection of interesting topics in the realm of data science / machine learning, applied to different energy use-cases.    
On a personal level, I live in a farm with my family outside Hamar, Norway. I am an eager ultra trail runner, the sport of running long distances in the mountains.
