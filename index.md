# Shepherding data to help organisations make decisions with new insights

This is the blog post of a data/ML scientist actually working in the precision farming sector at [Norsvin](https://norsvin.no/about-us/). Previously, I was working in the energy sector, at the smart battery producer [Hagal AS](https://www.hagal.com) and and at the Norwegian grid company [Elvia AS](https://www.elvia.no). In this blog, you can expect to find content related to data science, time series analysis, Python (the programing language), machine learning, computer vision and more. All this using data from the farming and energy sector.
