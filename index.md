# Shepherding data in an energy centric world

This is the blog post of a data scientist working in the energy sector, currently at the smart battery producer [Hagal AS](https://www.hagal.com) and previously at the Norwegian grid company [Elvia AS](https://www.elvia.no). In this blog, you can expect to find content related to data science, Python (the programing language) and machine learning. All this using data from the energy sector, both from distribution system operators, smart (or to be smart) homes, batteries and more.
