# Load forecasting at the secondary substation level

At [Elvia](https://www.elvia.no/), Norway's biggest distribution operators system in Norway, we had the chance to host our first iteration of what we called a Data Science Summer Camp. Four students were gather from the 15th of June to the 15th of August to work as a group (within the limits authorised by the health authorities) on a topic. [Gard Støe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gardstoe/), at the origin of this initiative, and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrcoello/) decided to propose four use cases of interest for the company, and the students picked up one to work on in the next 8 weeks.

Here's the table of contents:

## Use-Case

The students decided to look more in detail how could we forecast the load at the secondary substation level.

## Clustering

Key points to address:
 - standardizing every timeserie by reduce the whole period into an average week  (z-transform followed by average per week) N points-> 168 points
 - using this lower space representation to cluster between substation
 - assessing of cluster is dependant on how one uses this clusters -> Compactness, Differentiable, Substantial, Stable

Figures:  
 - three label-driven clusters for house / cabins / industry
 - three data-driven clusters and repartition of each label in these clusters
 - six data-driven clusters and repartition of each label in these clusters
