# Load forecasting at the secondary substation level

At [Elvia](https://www.elvia.no/), Norway's biggest distribution operators system in Norway, we had the chance to host our first iteration of what we called a Data Science Summer Camp. Four students were gather from the 15th of June to the 15th of August to work as a group (within the limits authorised by the health authorities) on a topic. [Gard Støe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gardstoe/), at the origin of this initiative, and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrcoello/) decided to propose four use cases of interest for the company, and the students picked up one to work on in the next 8 weeks.

Here's the table of contents:

## Use-Case

The students decided to look more in detail how could we forecast the load at the secondary substation level.  

*two figures already created*

## Clustering

*why clustering*  
*metadata-driven clustering vs. data-driven clustering*  
*assessing clusters*  
*interesting new clusters obtained with data driven clusters*  

## Forecasting

*ML methods*  
*challenges of real world dirty data*  
*The ocean of possibilities, how to choose a model*  
*Results with three different approaches*
